# Modular Lamp System

## Goal
I want to create a Lamp System whats extensible. (Like Philips Hue)

## How it´s working
If you want to create a ystem you have to connect to Bridge to the internet.
Then you can connect lamps by holding the Nfc-Tag on the Tag that´s built in the Bridge.
But you also need to controll the lamp, to do this you can use a Web-App or the 
Mobile-App. You can access the Web-App by entering the IP-Adress from Bridge in your Browser. If you´re using Mobile you need to go to the same Site but you have to add the app to your homescreen. When done that you can open the app from your homescreen.

## Getting Started
When opening the Mobile or Web-App for the first time you need to specify the bridge on your system. This can be done by going to the Devices tab and select your Bridge.
To controll a lamp you need to login with a user, who has rights, to access your needed room or lamp. At first there won´t be any users. To create a user, go to the Users Tab and select "New User". You will be asked to enter a master key this can be found in your delivered package on the introduction page.
